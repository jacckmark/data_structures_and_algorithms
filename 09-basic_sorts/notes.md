# BASIC SORTS

1. Bubble sort - bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. The first loop trough the list sorts elements locally and moves the biggest element to the end of list. Then we start over and move items once again (the second biggest element should land on the one before last spot in the list). And we repeat the process for rest of the elements. For first step we do n operations (where n is the number of items in the list) and for subsequent ones we do n - 1 (because we sorted the element on the end we don't need to compare the next elements to the biggest element in the list). So the amount of work will dwindling with each loop because if we already sorted 7 elements on the end we have only n-7 elements to loop over and compare in this given loop. The big O for bubble sort is $n^2$.
